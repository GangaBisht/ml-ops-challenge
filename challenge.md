### Machine Learning Ops Challenge

In this challenge, you will be tasked with deploying a pre-trained neural network to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. You will create an API to interact with the neural network for further training and inference. Additionally, you will containerize the application for easy deployment and scalability.

#### Requirements:

1. **Dataset**: Utilize the Fashion MNIST dataset available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist) for inferencing. Utilize a dataloader if necessary.

2. **Fine-tuned Neural Network**: Initialize a pre-trained neural network (tf-keras or torch) for inference.  We will not evaluate the performance of the model, so it's fine if the model does not work well on Fashion MNIST at all.

3. **API Development**: Create a RESTful API using FastAPI to allow interaction with the pre-trained neural network. The API should contain a single endpoint for online inferencing.

4. **Containerization**: Containerize the application using Docker to ensure easy deployment and portability across different environments.

5. **Readme**: Include a detailed README.md file explaining the project structure, how to set up the development environment, run and call the API. Follow Python best practices for code organization, documentation, and testing.

#### Submission Guidelines:

- Submit your solution as a GitHub repository with the code and necessary files.
- Ensure the README contains clear instructions for setting up and running the project.
- Follow Python best practices and provide comments/documentation where necessary.
- The solution should be easily reproducible and deployable.

#### Evaluation Criteria:

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. **Functionality**: Does the solution meet the requirements outlined in the challenge?
2. **Code Quality**: Is the code well-organized, readable, and modular?
3. **API Design**: Is the API well-designed, with a well-defined endpoint for online inference?
4. **Containerization**: Is the application properly containerized using Docker?
5. **Documentation**: Is the README.md file comprehensive and informative?

#### Additional Information:

- Feel free to use any additional libraries or tools that you find necessary.
- Ensure that the API endpoints are well-documented and tested for robustness.
- Aim for scalability and efficiency in your solution.
- You should not spend more than 4 hours on this task. 

Good luck with the challenge! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to myself and akash.patel@kognitiv.com for clarification.
